# Delhi NCR AQI Prediction & Risk Classification System

## Dataset

This project uses the **Delhi NCR Air Quality Dataset (2020–2025)**.

- Source: Kaggle  
- Contains hourly pollution and weather data  
- Cities: Delhi, Noida, Gurugram, Faridabad, Ghaziabad  

Due to size and licensing constraints, the dataset is **not included** in this repository.

### How to Get the Dataset

1. Download from Kaggle:

2. Create a folder named `data/` in the project root:

 *Delhi-NCR-AQI-Prediction/data/delhi_ncr_aqi_dataset.csv*
      
3. Run notebooks in order.

## Project Goal

To predict AQI values and classify air quality risk levels in the Delhi NCR region using machine learning and visualization.
